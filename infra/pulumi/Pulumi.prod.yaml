# Production stack configuration
#
# All configuration is pulled from Pulumi ESC environment 'gatrr-prod'.
# ESC is the single source of truth for both config and secrets.
#
# To set up:
# 1. Create environment 'gatrr-prod' in Pulumi Cloud (ESC → Environments)
# 2. Copy contents from esc.prod.yaml and update with real values:
#    - gatrr:baseDomain → your actual domain
#    - gatrr:acmeEmail → your email
#    - secrets:* → strong passwords
#
# Note: Client secrets (portalClientSecret, oauth2ProxyClientSecret, oauth2ProxyCookieSecret)
# are GENERATED by Pulumi on first deploy and persisted in state.

# Import all config and secrets from Pulumi ESC
environment:
  - gatrr/prod

# No config section needed - everything comes from ESC
# The encryptionsalt is for any locally-set secrets (not used with ESC)
